# Introduction

Hello and welcome to The Springmatter Design System documentation. The Springmatter Design System is a set of tools that enables us to rapidly create consistent and clear user experiences.

  It is extremely opinionated beacuse its intended use is to help us rapidly develop applications that are very specific to our needs.

### Principles

##### Agressively simple tooling and developer experience
  This is the primary reason the system is so opinionated. We aim for there to be very few decisions in the layout and development of our web applications. This leads to higher development speed while maintaining consistently well designed experiences and aesthetics. We rely on stnadard Vue.js practices, and existing web technologies wherever possible. We are very reluctant to add dependencies to our applications, and when we do we try to ensure that they are large, stable, and well supported open source projects.

##### Accessible from the start (Work in progress)
  One never knows when a client is going to have special needs, so we aim to have level AA conformance to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines built in to the system, and we encourage users of the system aim for this level of conformance in their local code.

##### Performance
  We aim to maximize performance to the best of our ability. This is mostly achieved automatically by keeping our dependencies light, but also requires continued effort to reduce image sizes, load data properly, and include only necessary information on each page.

##### Privacy
  We do not use external tools that track our users&#39; behavior and send it off to third parties.
