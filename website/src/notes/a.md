# Links

Links are pretty simple. They are just slightly styled `a` tags with some minor hover effects. 

Some cool features:

- If you put a `figure` inside an `a` tag it gains a cool hover effect (and also becomes a clickable link...)

- If you add the `class="black"` to an `a` tag you will get a black link.
