# Buttons

We have 4 types of buttons and they are chosen by setting the button's class to one of:
`primary | secondary | ghost | icon`.

You can also add icons to the buttons.

With text and icon:
```html
<button class="primary|secondary|ghost">
  Click me
  <SmIcon name="add" />
</button>
```

Icon button (no text):
```html
<button class="icon">
  <SmIcon name="map" />
</button>
```
