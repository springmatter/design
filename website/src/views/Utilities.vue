    <h1>Utilities</h1>
    <p>
      We provide a set of utility classes that are generated from a custom
      configuration of <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">tailwindcss</a>. Our
      classes differ slightly from the defaults at tailwind, but are mostly the
      same. We will be documenting our exact classes in the future, but for now
      you can mostly rely on the tailwind documentation.
